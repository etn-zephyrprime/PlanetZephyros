 * Planet Zephyros Name Marketplace V4
 *
 * A wrap-around service for Electroneum's ENS-fork naming system.
 *
 *  1) Registration brokerage: buyers register a new .etn name through this contract instead of
 *     calling ETHRegistrarController directly. This contract forwards the exact base price to
 *     the registrar, wraps the resulting name via NameWrapper straight into the buyer's wallet,
 *     and keeps a configurable brokerage fee on top (100% project revenue). Payable in ETN
 *     (unchanged from V3) or, via activateDomainWithToken, in any owner-whitelisted ERC20 —
 *     see that function's own comment for how the ETN-denominated fee gets converted.
 *
 *  2) Subname self-serve registration + resale: once a buyer owns a wrapped name, they can set a
 *     price — in ETN, or in any owner-whitelisted ERC20, or both at once — for anyone to
 *     self-register a subname of it (buyer picks the label, created on payment via
 *     NameWrapper.setSubnodeRecord), or list an already-wrapped name/subname they own for resale
 *     (resale stays ETN-only, unchanged from V3). Every subname sale splits 80% to the seller and
 *     20% into a pool, kept in whatever currency it was paid in, that is periodically swapped for
 *     CORE and burned via CORE.burn() — see buyBackAndBurn (ETN pool, unchanged from V3) and
 *     buyBackAndBurnToken (one ERC20 pool at a time, new in V4).
 *
 * V4 vs V3: subnamePricePerYear/setSubnamePricePerYear/registerSubname/quoteSubname all gained a
 * `paymentToken` parameter (address(0) = ETN, matching V3's behavior exactly when used that way).
 * whitelistedPaymentTokens/minSubnamePricePerYear are the new owner-controlled whitelist and
 * per-token price floor — no payment token is hardcoded, and neither is any minimum, including
 * ETN's own (set in the constructor, then owner-adjustable same as every other token). V3 has no
 * upgrade path (plain Ownable, immutable constructor wiring — confirmed, not assumed), so this is
 * a new deployment: migrateActivation lets a domain already activated on V3 carry that fact over
 * for free, by re-reading V3's own domainActivated as the source of truth, rather than an
 * off-chain admin migration list. Deliberately NOT migrated: existing V3 subname prices — those
 * stay each owner's own call to make again on V4, never something this contract or its owner sets
 * on their behalf (see setSubnamePricePerYear's own access control, unchanged: only the parent
 * domain's own owner/operator, exactly as V3 already enforced).
 *
 * Two more additions, both for day-one deploy convenience rather than the ongoing public flows
 * above:
 *
 *  - The constructor can seed initial ETN subname prices for domains the deployer already owns
 *    (see the InitialSubnamePrice struct below) — each entry is marked activated AND priced in
 *    one atomic step at deploy time, skipping the normal "activate, then separately set a price"
 *    two-call sequence. This is a deployer-trusted bootstrap, not a public function: it trusts the
 *    node hashes it's given rather than re-verifying real NameWrapper/BaseRegistrar ownership the
 *    way activateDomain does, since there's no "buyer" to prove ownership against here.
 *
 *  - goldlisted / setGoldlisted: an owner-controlled exemption list that waives the activation fee
 *    entirely for a specific node, still going through the real activateDomain/
 *    activateDomainWithToken flow (full ownership verification, wrap-if-needed, etc. — only the
 *    fee itself is skipped). Exists for the exact case a very-long-duration name produces: the
 *    minBrokerageFeePerYear floor scales with however much time is left on the name, so a name
 *    with (for example) a 100-year remaining expiry would otherwise floor at 100x a normal
 *    activation fee — not a pricing bug, just a formula that assumes ordinary registration
 *    durations, never designed for names that long-lived.
